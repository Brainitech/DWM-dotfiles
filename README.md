Arch Linux DWM Rice with Polybar

This is a custom configuration for Arch Linux's DWM window manager, with a custom rice and Polybar, a lightweight status bar for X11.
Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

    Arch Linux (or a compatible distribution)
    Git (to clone the repository)
    DWM (to use this configuration)
    Polybar (to use the custom status bar)

Installation

To install this configuration, follow these steps:

    Clone the repository:

bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git

    Make the autorice.sh file executable in Bash:

cd your-repo
chmod +x autorice.sh

    Run autorice.sh as sudo:

This script will automatically install the necessary packages, copy the configuration files to the appropriate locations, and restart DWM and Polybar to apply the changes.
Customization
